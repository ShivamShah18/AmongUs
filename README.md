# Space Station Simulation: Amogus Edition  

Welcome to the **Space Station Simulation**!  
This project is a fun and interactive game that simulates a space station filled with Amogus characters, one of whom is secretly an impostor. The impostor can move around, drag characters, and "unalive" other players by overlapping with them.  

---

## **Features**  
- Interactive gameplay with up to 8 Amogus characters.  
- A randomly assigned impostor that can "kill" other characters.  
- Dynamic background and character movement.  
- Mouse and keyboard controls for adding and interacting with players.  

---

## **Gameplay**  
The simulation begins with one Amogus character. Additional players can be added, and one random player is assigned as the impostor.  
The impostor can interact with and "kill" other players by overlapping with them.  

---

## **Controls**  

Here are the controls to interact with the game:  

- **`A` key**: Adds a new Amogus character to the game at a random position with a random color.  
- **Mouse Hover**: Hovering over an Amogus character prints `Mouse is over amogus!` in the console.  
- **Mouse Click**: Clicking on an Amogus character allows you to "drag" it around the screen.  
- **Mouse Release**: Releasing the mouse stops dragging the character.
